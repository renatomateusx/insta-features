# insta-features

project made to revist some concepts. I didn't finish yet. But you can run on iPhone Simulator.

# features
> SDWebImage
> UISearchBar
> TabBar
> CollectionView
> Programmatic Screens
> XibFiles
> StoryBoard

# attention
don't forgot to open the InstaFeatures.xcworkspace file after you give the pod install if needed.
